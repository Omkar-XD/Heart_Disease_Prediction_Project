# Heart_Disease_Prediction_Project
* Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease based on various health metrics using machine learning algorithms. The backend is implemented in Python, and the frontend is designed using HTML and CSS to create an interactive user interface.


🔥 Features
- **Heart Disease Prediction**: Predicts the likelihood of heart disease based on user input.
- **Interactive User Interface**: Allows users to input health data through HTML forms.
- **Machine Learning Model**: Utilizes algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest to predict the presence of heart disease.

🛠️ Technologies Used
- **Backend**: Python
  - Machine Learning Algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Trees)
  - Pandas, NumPy for data processing
  - Scikit-learn for model training and evaluation
  - Jupyter Notebook for data exploration and model development
  
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS
  - User input collection through HTML forms
  - CSS for styling and layout of the form and results page
